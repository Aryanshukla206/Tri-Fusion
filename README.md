## **Project Overview**

**Tri-Fusion** is a comprehensive image processing toolkit website, inspired by Rafael Gonzalezâ€™s **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** book. Built using Python and the Streamlit framework, this toolkit offers a wide range of image processing tasks through a user-friendly interface, allowing for seamless real-time interaction with images.

### **Key Objectives:**
- Provide a web-based platform for essential image processing operations.
- Simplify complex image processing techniques for non-expert users.
- Offer a robust set of tools for both basic and advanced image manipulation.

## **Features**

- **Image Sharpening and Smoothing**: 
    - Apply various filters to enhance or smooth image quality.
- **Basic Image Transformations**: 
    - Implement common transformations such as rotation, scaling, and cropping.
- **Morphological Operations**: 
    - Perform dilation, erosion, opening, and closing operations on images.
- **Interactive Interface**: 
    - Select and apply tasks through an intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Real-time Processing**: 
    - View and interact with processed images in real-time.

## **Usage**

1. Open the web interface of the toolkit.
2. Upload an image from your local storage.
3. Select the desired image processing task (e.g., sharpening, smoothing).
4. Adjust the operation parameters using the sliders.
5. Preview the processed image instantly and download the result.
